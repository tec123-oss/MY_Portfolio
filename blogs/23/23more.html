    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest yet most effective algorithms used in machine learning. It is a non-parametric algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. KNN works by identifying the 'K' closest data points to a given point and making predictions based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. In this blog, we will dive into how KNN works, its applications, advantages, and limitations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How KNN Works</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>The working of KNN is quite straightforward. When a new data point needs to be classified or predicted, the algorithm finds the 'K' nearest data points (neighbors) to the new data point. The distance between the data points is usually calculated using metrics like Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.</p>
            <h3>Steps in KNN:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose the number of neighbors 'K'.</li>
                <li>Calculate the distance between the new data point and all the points in the training dataset.</li>
                <li>Sort the calculated distances and select the 'K' nearest neighbors.</li>
                <li>For classification: Assign the most frequent class among the 'K' neighbors. For regression: Compute the average of the neighbors' values.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Applications of KNN</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>KNN is widely used across various domains due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Some common applications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Recognition:</strong> KNN can be used to classify images based on pixel values, often used in facial recognition and object detection systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> KNN can be used to suggest products, movies, or other items by finding users with similar preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong> KNN can assist in diagnosing diseases by comparing a patient's symptoms with historical data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Advantages of KNN</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> KNN is easy to understand and implement. There is no need for training data as it is a lazy learner algorithm.</li>
                <li><strong>No Assumptions:</strong> KNN makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it suitable for a wide range of data types.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> KNN can be used for both classification and regression tasks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Disadvantages of KNN</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Computational Cost:</strong> KNN can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, as it requires calculating the distance between the query point and all other points in the dataset.</li>
                <li><strong>Sensitive to Irrelevant Features:</strong> If there are many irrelevant features, KNN may perform poorly as it will be affected by the noise in the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Choosing 'K':</strong> The performance of KNN is highly dependent on the choice of the number 'K'. A small value for K might lead to overfitting, while a large value might underfit the data.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>K-Nearest Neighbors is a powerful, easy-to-understand algorithm used widely for classification and regression. Its simplicity makes it a go-to choice for beginners, and its performance can be impressive when applied to appropriate problems. However, it is important to consider its computational cost and limitations in high-dimensional spaces. By understanding these factors, KNN can be a great addition to your machine learning toolkit.</p>
